- 👋 Hello, I’m @WilliamDavidBurton !  I go by William or David.  I'm a recent Master's graduate from the University of Massachusetts, and this is where I show projects that are either completed or in-process that I'm proud of, now that I am out of school.
- 👀 I’ve always been interested in low level coding!  I love coding in C, computer architecture, and programming under constraints of space or time.  My school course load was focused on algorithms and systems!
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on brushing up on some of my C code -- while I focused on coding fundamentals, my skill in the language itself gained some rust, and I never did quite get the hang of Makefiles and macros.  I've already brushed off some of the rust, and I'm looking to improve my skills in the areas that I lack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything, really!  I'm here to learn and to show what I'm relatively proud of.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email, WMDavidBurton@gmail.com !  Shoot me an email if you have any questions or want to work with me!
- Currently, I'm working on two primary projects -- generic C code for data structures and various sorting methods that can work with any data type, and redoing my favorite old school project entirely in C.  CPU emulator go!
